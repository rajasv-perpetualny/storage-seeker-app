]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward with a renovation can be stressful for any relationship. The LA Times says renovations fall somewhere between </span><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/03/realestate/re-5852"><span style="font-weight: 400;">infidelity and meddling mother-in-laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while </span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-deal-with-stress-during-renovations-2016-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Insider</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states, “&#8230;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">remodeling — or tackling any major undertaking as a couple — brings up dilemmas that are blind to geographic location, ethnicity and culture.” Before starting any home-renovation project, consider these simple tips to keep your project </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">organized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, helping you and your partner keep stress at a minimum.</span><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Finding a Reputable Contractor </b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Angie’s List, there are </span><a href="https://www.angieslist.com/articles/6-tips-hiring-reputable-contractor.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 Tips for Hiring a Reputable Contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which include ensuring they are </span><a href="https://www.nari.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NARI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (National Association of The Remodeling Industry) certified, fully insured and bonded, and positively reviewed. Remember, going with the lowest bid isn’t always the best idea. You want your project performed without hassle, so choose the contractor that provides a fair price and service combination along with having excellent referrals.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to ask contractors </span><a href="https://www.homeadvisor.com/r/15-questions-to-ask-contractors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">specific questions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about your project, such as if they anticipate any issues arising and how they handled issues with similar projects in the past. Listen carefully to their answers to gauge their experience and ability to handle the job.</p>
<p></span><b>Maximize Space While You Work</p>
<p></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are tearing down walls, replacing wiring, removing pipes and sanding down cabinets, you are in for a mess of a lifetime. Instead of moving valuable items from room to room in an effort to give you more space to work, consider renting a </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to maximize space and keep your items damage-free. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storage units</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are climate-controlled and under 24/7 surveillance, so you can rest assured your items will be safe and secure (while your home is in disarray). With sizes designed to fit any budget, finding one that won’t break the bank (while you break down walls) will put your mind and wallet at ease. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Determining Your Homes Value</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are renovating with the intention to sell or are simply interested in learning what your homes value will be without obtaining a formal appraisal, real estate websites such as </span><a href="http://www.zillow.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zillow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.trulia.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trulia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can provide you with estimates based on other properties in your area. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, not every renovation project will increase your homes value, so be sure to research if you are solely </span><a href="http://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/10-tips-to-increase-your-homes-value"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renovating to sell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Renovated kitchens and bathrooms, as well as new windows are typically eye-catching for potential home buyers, whereas new electric or plumbing may go unnoticed. Speak with your realtor to determine the best course of action for you and your partner. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Decorating &amp; De-cluttering Ideas</p>
<p></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your home is renovated, finding neat ways to decorate your home is simple, with websites offering </span><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/explore/diy-home-decor/?lp=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">countless ideas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make your home perfect for the both of you. You may even be able to </span><a href="http://www.countryliving.com/diy-crafts/how-to/g2126/repurposed-wood-hometalk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">re-purpose old wood from your demolition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create unique pieces you and your partner will love! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If clutter was something you struggled with pre-renovation, consider </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keeping your self storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after the renovation is through. You can store seasonal items such as clothing, decor or sports equipment year round, leaving you more room for items you need on a regular basis, while clearing your living space.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>You Are A Team…</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, home renovations can be stressful, especially when things don’t go as planned, but it is important to remember you and your partner are a team. Discuss your expectations, set your budget and even create a “safe” room in your house that is renovation-free, so that you have an opportunity to unwind and relax. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy Renovating!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It always happens right after the holidays. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An influx of stuff as far as the eye can see.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have old items and new.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gifts and garbage.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than pull your hair out in disarray and begin searching for a new home, take a moment to step back, regroup and breathe.</p>
<p></span>Your stuff is not in control of you, you are in control of it (it just doesn’t feel like that right now).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us help you de-clutter, de-stress and get things in order (cue Rocky theme music) to set your new year up for success.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>The Closet of Doom</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, we all have one. That closet that sits at the back of the hall known as the land-o-junk. Items piled high as the ceiling, with no reason or order to anything placed there. Nothing ever comes out, but things always go in. How this closet hasn’t caved into the floor is a mystery, but you’re ready to face it head on (did we mention, Rocky music?).</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place three extremely large plastic bins on the floor (easy to find at </span><a href="http://www.acehardware.com/home/index.jsp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or any home improvement center) and label them Keep, Donate and Dispose (aka, JUNK). Sort accordingly.</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If items are ones you believe truly have a purpose, hang on to them to </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">organize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If they aren’t purposeful to you but may be to someone else, give them to the </span><a href="http://www.goodwill.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodwill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And if you are pretty confident they’re junk (most of that stuff likely is) TOSS it, cause </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFEoMO0pc7k"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ain’t nobody got time for that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</p>
<p></span><b>About Face!</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
According to Business Insider, we only wear </span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/people-dont-wear-most-of-their-clothes-2013-4"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 20% of our clothing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In order to determine what you truly need to keep within your closet and what you don’t, flip all of your hangers around the opposite way (placing the item/hanger back the appropriate way once you use it). You’ll know if you haven’t touched an item by July because the hanger will still be flipped, and you’ll have no excuse to stop you from donating it to your local </span><a href="http://www.salvationarmy.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">salvation army</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (unless of course you feel it’s better left to the trash).</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a small closet to begin with and need a space to keep seasonal clothing or decor, consider </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renting a self storage unit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in your neighborhood. With many different sizes to choose from, locating one that works within your budget should be quite simple, and will help you maximize much needed space for items you need on a regular basis at home.</p>
<p></span><b>What exactly is in the pantry?</p>
<p></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feel like you have a ton of food in your pantry but not entirely sure what’s in there? It’s time to do a deep clean to remove any expired product and determine what exactly you have and need. Once cleared out, consider </span><a href="http://www.bhg.com/kitchen/storage/pantry/organize-your-pantry-by-zones/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">organizing your pantry by zones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You’ll be surprised how much you save by not buying duplicates (and will also feel as if the items you have on hand are useful, rather than shelves lined with mystery food).</p>
<p></span><b>Pick up your mess…</p>
<p></b>Keeping your home clutter free is a lifestyle, and one that can be embraced with minor, daily changes.<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
Emptying your pockets? Place keys in small baskets and put your change in a piggy bank.</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have garbage? Throw it out in real time (enlightening, we know).</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holding onto an item? If you can’t think of a real reason to keep it, don’t!</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year is the one where your home becomes your </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">organized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, de-cluttered sanctuary.</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the new and improved clutter-free you!</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I33u_EHLI3w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rocky</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, go!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your hobby is an important part of your life, and in an effort to start the new year off pursuing things that give you joy and </span><a href="https://www.shape.com/lifestyle/mind-and-body/hobbies-reduce-stress-just-well-exercise"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alleviate stress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you’ve decided to partake in your hobby on a regular basis. There’s just one problem. Your hobby takes up too much room. Don’t sweat! These helpful tips will keep your hobby organized, leaving your home clutter-free and yourself, well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">happy!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Crafts &amp; Collectibles</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partake in hobbies that have numerous small pieces, such as scrap-booking, coin or stamp collecting, Lego building, sewing or robotics? Purchase some clear storage bins and other small, clear containers to keep each item organized and separated from the other. Be sure to label each bin accordingly so that you know which holds what, keeping a running list of the items you have on hand within bins so that you are not sorting through every one when you need something. You can keep your clear bins within your closet, garage or attic, or even within a </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local self storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> near you.</span><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><b>Classic Cars, Boats or Racing?</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Into classic cars, boating or racing? Consider </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renting a self storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in your area to help you maximize space at home (unless you have the garage space for those items… if so, more power to you!). Units offer 24/7 surveillance, keeping your prized possessions secure. You may even be able to rent several units next door to one another should you have multiple cars or boats to store. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Private Painting or Writing Studio</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set your </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> up into a private art or writing gallery, giving you the time and space you need to be creative without interruption. Since most units are climate controlled, your pieces will not be damaged by the elements, giving you peace of mind. Plus, if you write or paint for a living, you may be able to use your storage unit as a </span><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/professional/complete-list-of-self-employed-expenses-and-tax-deductions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tax deduction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the year. As always, speak with your tax professional for more information.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Unlimited Train Layouts</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love building </span><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/explore/model-train-layouts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">model train layouts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but can’t seem to find the space to build as intricate a layout as you would like? With various sizes designed to meet your specific needs, renting a </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can provide you with the room to build as far, wide and tall as you like, creating a layout you and your kids will enjoy for years to come (without taking up much needed square footage at home).</p>
<p></span><b>Sports Equipment</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy golfing? Kayaking? Baseball? Football? Soccer? Place your sports equipment into your </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, rotating through gear as the sports season changes over the course of the year.<br />
</span><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make New Year&#8217;s goals. Dig within, and discover what you would like to have happen in your life this year. This helps you do your part. It is an affirmation that you&#8217;re interested in fully living life in the year to come.”<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></i><b><i>Melody Beattie</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wishing you a wonderful New Year, filled with the things you enjoy! Happy 2018!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s that time of year again! A season of new beginnings and fresh starts. A moment filled with the hope of all you’ll accomplish, without the regrets of what you have not. Like most, you’re more focused than ever to improve upon your overall health, thinking up weight loss goals, clean eating agendas and stress fixes to help you grow stronger each day throughout the year.</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that navigating against unhealthy patterns and habits in order to obtain the wellness milestones you so desperately want to reach can be a challenge. That’s why we’ve created these 3 simple tips to help make 2018 a successful year towards a better you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>MEAL PLANNING</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than wondering what it is you’re going to eat throughout the day and week (which leads to binge eating), plan your meals and snacks out each day, having the items you are going to indulge in ready to go. There are different sites that can help you create </span><a href="https://www.pritikin.com/your-health/healthy-living/eating-right/1720-healthy-meal-plan-for-weight-loss.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthy, delicious meal plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meal-Prep-Book-Essential-Beginners-ebook/dp/B0747XL2WM/ref=sr_1_sc_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514495967&amp;sr=8-2-spell&amp;keywords=books+healthy+mealplanning"><span style="font-weight: 400;">books that can lead you through the process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so that when you eat you aren’t giving into cravings, but choosing to nourish your body with the foods that are best for it.</p>
<p></span>Approaching food the same way you would a budget gives you the opportunity to engage in eating from a position of strength, instead of weakness. When eating from a position of strength we have the advantage of making better decisions with regard to the foods we are partaking in, instead of making decisions based on time constraints or sugar addictions.</p>
<p><b>EXERCISE ROUTINES</p>
<p></b><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">With countless </span><a href="https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/9-reasons-working-out-at-home-is-better"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blogs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.fitnessmagazine.com/workout/tips/benefits-of-at-home-workout/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">articles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPfiKwR1ULo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">videos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stating that working out at home is more effective than working out at the gym, people are more determined than ever to get that great gym workout without ever leaving their living room. The only trouble is, most people do not have the necessary space available to set up the equipment they need, as a treadmill and weight set alone take up a large amount of space. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to enjoy the comforts of exercising in private (without taking up precious square footage at home), people have started utilizing </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self-storage units</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as their own personal gyms. Units are climate controlled, come in various sizes and are typically located locally within each neighborhood. Since prices are competitive, finding a unit that works within any budget is a breeze (especially when you are not paying for a crowded gym membership, but renting for your own private one). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>GET ORGANIZED</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making your home environment one that is clutter-free and organized can help you approach this year with a feeling of peace instead of chaos.

Remember, if it’s not </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">worth keeping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, isn’t worth </span><a href="http://www.goodwill.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">donating </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and has no purpose for the foreseeable future,  do yourself a favor and just toss it away.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Year is here!</p>
<p></span>New goals! New opportunities! A new chance at fresh start!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to begin to make good on your New Year&#8217;s resolutions, creating an environment that is orderly and stress free is important. According to the US News article, </span><a href="https://health.usnews.com/wellness/mind/articles/2016-11-08/why-decluttering-is-good-for-your-health"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why DeCluttering Is Good For Your Health</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;removing unneeded and unwanted things from your home or office, is not a new concept, but its health benefits have become increasingly recognized.”</p>
<p></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to get your home organized to make good on your promise for a healthier you, you will have to decide what it is you want to keep, what it is you want to </span><a href="http://www.salvationarmy.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">give to others</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and what it is you want to put out by the curb. While making those decisions can seem overwhelming, these simple tips will help you maximize space, giving you the tools necessary to continuously fight clutter throughout the new year.</p>
<p></span><b>KEEP CLOTHING BINS ON HAND </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place three separate bins on your closet floor, labeled Seasonal, Donate and Discard. As you go through your wardrobe, place items in the appropriate bin, utilizing a </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local self-storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep your seasonal clothing away until needed. If you are having a hard time deciding between donate and discard, think about whether you plan on wearing an item within the next 4-6 months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and be realistic. If you can’t envision yourself in it, can you envision someone else? If so, </span><a href="http://www.goodwill.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">donate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you can’t, then discard (especially if the item is tattered beyond repair). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>SPACE SAVING IDEAS</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Racks that </span><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Garage-Storage-Garage-Shelves-Racks-Ceiling-Mounted-Racks/N-5yc1vZccyy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hang from the ceiling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/sb1/murphy-beds-c46122-a3005~31911.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wall beds with storage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><a href="http://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/clean-and-organize/what-we-love-best-pantry-organizers-pictures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bins specifically designed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make your pantry functional, are all simple ways you can maximize space. If closet space is tight, consider color coordinating items placed in baskets or utilizing the back of doors to hang belongings. With so many </span><a href="http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/organizing/g2911/linen-closet-organization-tricks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">different ideas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you get full use out of your closets, there’s really no limit to what you can store and keep organized.</p>
<p></span><b>KEEP LARGER ITEMS AWAY</p>
<p></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sports equipment, seasonal decor and tools that are not needed on a regular basis are best kept off site in a </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within your neighborhood. Units come in various sizes, with climate control features and 24-7 surveillance to keep your belongings are safe. Best of all, with larger items away, your home will feel more spacious and clear, giving you peace of mind.</p>
<p></span><b>BE INTENTIONAL</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Albert Einstein once said, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of clutter, find simplicity.”</span><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a willingness to part with some belongings while being mindful to best utilize your space, you are certain to start the new year right. Let’s make 2018 a year when you’re in control of you stuff (and your stuff isn’t in control of you). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishing you a prosperous and healthy 2018!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With festivities coming to an end, finding ways to get back into your routine can be a bit challenging. The kids seem to be on a constant sugar high, your pants don’t quite fit, your home is filled to the brim with stuff and your wallet feels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">well, depleted. These simple tips will help your family get back on track, maximizing space, saving money, and dropping pounds.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Okay, so maybe we can’t help much in the weight department, but we’ll do our darndest!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>De-Clutter</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you take down your Christmas decor and put up your usual momentos, consider placing seasonal items in a local </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Doing such will allow you to free-up space at home for items you need on a regular basis, keeping your home clutter-free. With most locations offering units of varying sizes under 24/7 surveillance, you can rest assured that your belongings are safe (without breaking the bank). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to have a running list of items you place in storage on hand so that you can keep track of what items are inside. Number boxes to coincide with your list as well, so that finding items when you need them will be a breeze. Check out our article, </span><a href="http://blog.storageseeker.com/main/keep-storage-unit-organized"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Keep Your Storage Unit Organized</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for some more ideas to keep things orderly. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><br />
</b><b>Recycle</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">So your sugared up minions are up to their ears in toys, leaving your home filled to capacity and your wee ones in a psychotic </span><a href="https://www.todaysparent.com/toddler/a-guide-for-sharing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this is mine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t touch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, die sibling die</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">frenzy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to tame those little beasts and get them to a place of appreciation, reorganize their toys into groups of three, leaving only one group out at a time. You can place the other two groups into separate bins within your home or </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and rotate through them every 2-3 weeks. Your children will be happy to play with toys they haven’t seen in some time, keeping them entertained and excited, rather than overwhelmed and well, crazy!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><br />
</b><b>Budget</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know you spent more than you should have. Every year you promise you won’t be in the red, and yet, here you are with a checkbook glowing like Rudolph&#8217;s nose on a wintery Christmas night. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of becoming overwhelmed by your financial situation, make a conscious effort to </span><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/how-a-food-budget-got-us-out-of-debt-and-4-steps-to-help-you-create-your-own-budget-216501"><span style="font-weight: 400;">get back on track</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, creating a realistic budget and spending plan to help you meet your financial goals. Our tips to </span><a href="http://blog.storageseeker.com/main/save-money-stay-organized-holiday-season"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help You Save Money This Holiday Season</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://blog.storageseeker.com/main/earn-extra-cash-holiday-season"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earn Some Extra Cash</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can  help as well, so be firm in setting your limits in order to tackle those debts before they tackle you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><br />
</b><b>Fatness<br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t blame the holidays (you were pretty plump in August), but the eggnog, biscottini, deep fried whatever-ma-jigs and ham dipped in molasses didn’t help your get in shape cause. We personally think your rolls make you more loveable, but we all could do some hunkering down to get healthier for the new year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tips to help you </span><a href="http://www.health.com/weight-loss/9-easy-ways-to-sneak-in-exercise"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incorporate exercise into your everyday life</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will make exercise become less of a chore and more of a lifestyle. Determine what it is you would like to achieve with regard to your health and think of </span><a href="https://www.today.com/health/6-simple-ways-get-healthy-2017-t106471"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tangible ways to get there</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With some dedication and your Doctor’s go ahead, you can say hello to a healthier you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><br />
</b><b>Reflect</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cherish the memories you made this holiday season and be thankful, even with the stress (and poundage). As Winston Churchill once said, “Christmas is a season not only of rejoicing but of reflection.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy Holidays. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gifts for this one and gifts for that, decorations, events, planning, photos, greeting cards, traveling, in-laws… Santa needs a cocktail, folks. A great big cocktail.</p>
<p></span>With all that goes into what this season brings, plummeting into the red (and we’re not talking vibrant Christmas decor red) is not something you need to ring in the new year.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to avoid starting 2018 in the negative, consider some of these money saving and </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">organizing tips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you tighten your belts a little extra this Christmas season.</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, don’t tighten them too much… think pie. Lots of pie.</p>
<p></span><b>Say No To Clutter</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
Keep holiday decor, gifts, and other seasonal items, packed away in a </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with an updated list of all that you have in order to help you to avoid unnecessary spending. You can pull items out of storage as you need them (and place items there that you don’t), leaving you with less clutter and chaos as you go about the month of December.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Make Running Lists</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make lists of all the gifts you need to purchase, as well as </span><a href="http://www.geniuskitchen.com/ideas/budget-minded-holiday-menus-2-6392"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lists of menu items</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for meals you are preparing. Ensure your lists fit within your typical monthly budget, as not to exceed what you usually spend any given week. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Made With Love</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than purchasing expensive gifts for those you hold dear, consider getting a little creative by making items to give to loved ones. </span><a href="http://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/g1059/homemade-food-gifts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baked goodies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.hgtv.com/design/make-and-celebrate/handmade/55-crafty-handmade-gift-ideas-pictures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">beautiful decor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are certain to please your closest family and friends. If you have young children, have them join in the fun, </span><a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/276932/christmas-gifts-kids-can-make-for-parent"><span style="font-weight: 400;">making their own gifts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for those who are important to them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Group Gifts</p>
<p></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask family or friends to do a grab bag or secret Santa this Christmas, with each person only having to purchase one or two items. If you have a large gathering, this option is ideal, and with </span><a href="http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/holidays/gift-ideas/g4572/creative-white-elephant-gift-ideas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various fun and exciting ways to exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you’ll build memories for years to come.</p>
<p></span><b>Experiences Instead</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if you and your loved ones scratched gift giving and decided to go to an event together (each covering the cost of his or her ticket)? Christmas shows, sporting events, escape rooms, the theater, concerts… </span><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/3025924729828167/?lp=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">there’s no limit to what you can enjoy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with one another.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Price Max</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lay the rules on the table early and decide what the maximum is each person should spend per gift. Depending on the size of your gathering and the situation of those attending, setting a $10 or $15 limit (or whatever works for you) can help everyone feel comfortable, without the stress of having to </span><a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-holiday-gifts-spending-20161124-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spend more than they have</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>It’s Not About The Presents…</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christmas is a time to reflect on the things that matter most to us in life, not on our wallets or on our checkbooks or on the gifts received from others.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen.</p>
<p></span>Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But do you recall… that Santa needs some </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for it all?</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, yes!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the holiday season upon us, finding creative ways to stay organized through the craziness Christmas can bring is imperative to not only keep your sanity, but to keep the whole operation running smoothly.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These simple tips will help you do Christmas with ninja-like precision. You’ll be making meals, baking cakes, decorating and wrapping like the jolly little elf on a shelf you are, so sing that holiday tune and get your yule log ready, because we’re rocking around the Christmas tree in three, two, one&#8230;  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Keep Presents Hidden Until Christmas Morning</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renting a </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides Santa with the opportunity to keep gifts away from prying eyes and little fingers, ensuring Christmas morning is filled with many heart-felt surprises.</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By placing presents, wrapped, marked and labeled within neatly packed boxes, loading the gifts from the unit to the… uh, sleigh, will be as quick and simple as eating every last bite of those </span><a href="http://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/christmas/g2177/easy-christmas-cookies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">succulent cookies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> waiting by the tree. Cause let’s face it. That’s pretty darn easy.</p>
<p></span><b>Store Seasonal Decor And More</p>
<p></b>Listen, the North Pole isn’t decked out in decorations all year long. Mrs. Claus wouldn’t stand for it, and neither would the elves. They’re sick of it all by New Years.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to maximize space within your home for items you need all year round, consider keeping your Christmas decor in a </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self-storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nearby. With many different sizes designed to fit any budget, you’ll be able to find one that is perfectly suited for your specific needs.</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can even use your storage unit to keep other decor, landscaping items or sports equipment that is seasonal, and rotate them from your unit to your home (and back) as you need them.</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGV_blvnmvs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa keeps his jet-skis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in storage?</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">True story.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>&#8230;And May All Your Christmases Be Bright</p>
<p></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/therese-borchard/holiday-stress_b_1138990.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">difficult family members</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Gotta love them!</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a mother-in-law who enjoys making comments about the cleanliness of your home, or an Aunt that “accidentally” goes through all of your stuff?</p>
<p></span>Mr. Claus too. They visit from the South Pole and just take everything over.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we’re not going to tell you to keep them in your </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this Christmas (though it would make for a wonderful time of the year!), but rather, de-clutter and clear out by placing personal items or larger items away during your celebrations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know this season can be hectic. Mrs. Claus told us exclusively that Santa can even turn into a real grump. But rather than become overwhelmed by the logistics of it all, take a moment to reflect on what really matters this season. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Christmas is a necessity. There has to be at least one day of the year to remind us that we’re here for something else besides ourselves.” </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Eric Sevareid</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">May your focus be on your faith, your family and your friends.</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many blessings to you and yours this holiday season and new year!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holiday season is upon us! Christmas tunes blasting and cookies galore, nostalgia certainly sets in as we cherish our time with those we hold dear. These festive DIY holiday ideas will  bring the whole family together, helping you and your children make memories that will last a lifetime. </span></p>
<p><b>Crafts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding crafts that are easy enough for the kids to partake in (while pretty enough to display) can sometimes be a bit of a challenge, but this list of </span><a href="http://www.hgtv.com/design/make-and-celebrate/handmade/50-christmas-crafts-for-kids-pictures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60 unique ideas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are certainly a great place to start. From making a Christmas plate for Santa, to creating a beautiful snowman out of boxes, these crafts will brighten your home and your holiday season the whole winter through.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, little ones can always help with simple tasks, such as color coordinating supplies, using stickers or selecting accent pieces, so give them a job to do and watch them light up. And if your Santa has a beard on his bottom, just sit back and smile, knowing your Picasso has created a masterpiece. It will be conversation starter for years to come!<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Foods</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes! There are such things as tasty treats without the hassle of baking. Just mix together these </span><a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/menus-holidays-parties/mhplibrary/holidays/11-no-bake-christmas-treats-to-make-with-kids"><span style="font-weight: 400;">creative snack ideas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the holidays to keep your kids entertained from Thanksgiving until the New Year. With reindeer pretzels, elf treats and fruity snowmen on the menu (something healthy!), the wee ones will be pleased (and mom and dad will be too).</p>
<p></span>If your kids are a bit older or fairly neat in the kitchen, consider letting them whip up some of these items as party appetizers or as gifts for family and friends! A special treat, made with love,  that didn’t break the bank. We call that a win-win!<br />
<b><br />
Decor</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
Keep it simple, finding a common color or theme to coordinate your decor. Give each member of the family a task, allowing them to pick items to decorate a particular area as per your theme. If using exterior lighting, ensure outlets and extension cords are made to face the elements in order to avoid a </span><a href="http://www.diynetwork.com/how-to/skills-and-know-how/electrical-and-wiring/outdoor-christmas-lighting-tips"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hazardous situation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between all of your lighting, inflatables, figurines, nativities and dueling snowmen fighting an epic star wars battle (we know you’re that cool), finding a place to keep your decor when the season is up can be difficult. By renting a </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can keep your belongings safe and secure until the next holiday season, maximizing your space at home for items you need the whole year through. </span></p>
<p><b>Sentimentals</p>
<p></b><a href="https://handsonaswegrow.com/30-homemade-ornaments-for-the-kids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ornaments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTw0Mtv718I"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scrapbooks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are wonderful mementos for your kids to make to remember the holiday season or bless someone you love. With some extra attention to detail and a delicate touch, your handcrafted decor and albums will have real meaning for each member of your family. Perfection is not necessary, just an enthusiastic heart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maybe Christmas, he thought&#8230; doesn’t come from a store. Maybe Christmas, perhaps… means a little bit more!”<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Dr. Seuss</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These easy ideas to help you enjoy your holiday and remain </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">organized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thereafter are certain to make this Christmas season one to remember. We wish you the brightest of holidays!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In just a few short weeks, an influx of items are about to hit your door, making a home that’s already struggling to remain organized a nightmare to tackle. These useful tips will help you decide what to get rid of, donate and store, with some easy ideas to get your belongings in order. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Keep. Donate. Discard.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you tackle each closet or room in your home, create three piles to sort items into. If you (genuinely) can foresee yourself or a loved one using a particular item within the next six months, place it in your keep pile. Remember, these are items that you have a realistic purpose and plan for, not belongings you are unsure about.</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Items that you do not need, but feel others may, should be placed within your donate pile. Your local </span><a href="http://www.goodwill.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodwill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="http://www.salvationarmyusa.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salvation Army</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as different </span><a href="https://good360.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">non-profit organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can typically find use for most items that are in good condition. Depending on the item and how your taxes are filed, you may actually qualify to write your </span><a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/valuation-guide-for-donated-goods.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">donation off</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, helping with your overall refund. As always speak with your tax professional to determine what is best for your situation.</p>
<p></span>And everything else? Discard, and don’t think twice. The goal here is to de-clutter, not hang on to. While it may be challenging to let certain items go, think about the freedom you will feel by not allowing possessions to rule your life. Memories do not need to be attached to things to make us happy, they only need to be attached to our hearts.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><b>How to Organize What You Keep</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use color coordinated bins, accessory holders and closet organizers to help you keep your </span><a href="http://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/clean-and-organize/organizing-the-clothes-closet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">belongings in order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Utilize walls in closets with peg boards, or high shelving with some collapsable containers. You can even purchase drawer or under-the-bed organizers to help you maximize space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For seasonal items, consider renting a </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self-storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within your neighborhood to rotate belongings into throughout the year. With different sizes and price points available, finding one that works perfectly for your family will be easy, leaving you more space for items you need to have readily at hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If renting storage, be sure to keep a running checklist of items you place within, clearly marking boxes to ensure you are able to find what you need. Check out our post, </span><a href="http://blog.storageseeker.com/main/keep-storage-unit-organized"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Keep Your Storage Unit Organized</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for some more tips and tricks.</p>
<p></span><b>Make Staying Organized a Priority</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the season comes to a close, make a point to continuously de-clutter your home as you go. Keep the list of threes in mind as you accumulate belongings the whole year through, asking yourself if this item is one you should keep, donate or discard.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good order is the foundation of all things. –Edmund Burke</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With organization a focal point for things </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you need to keep</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a willingness to let go of things you don’t, this holiday season will be one that won’t leave you stressed over space. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy Holidays to you and yours!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When autumn hits, Thanksgiving, Christmas and the New Year tend to come quickly, leaving us with a never ending list of things to do. While the song isn’t wrong by claiming it’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Most Wonderful Time of the Year</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it can certainly be the most stressful. Determining where to celebrate and with whom can be a challenge, as well as maintaining our homes, preparing for company, and </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">finding the perfect location</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to store our decor.</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the age old English Proverb goes, the three phrases that sum up Christmas are, “&#8230;Peace on Earth, Goodwill to Men, and Batteries not Included.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These simple tips will help you maintain some order this holiday season, providing you with opportunities to enjoy, rather than worry.</p>
<p></span><b>Choose Your Priorities… And Make Yourself One!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sit down with your partner to determine what your priorities are this holiday season. Who are you set on seeing, who can you do without seeing (crazy political relatives, perhaps?), and where are you willing to travel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if at all. Most importantly, set aside time to do things that you personally want to do, even if that’s simply watching </span><a href="http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/holidays/christmas-ideas/g1315/best-christmas-movies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheesy movies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with your wee-ones while eating a tub of popcorn (we won’t judge). As much as you love all of those who are in your life, making that time for yourself and your own immediate family is important too.</p>
<p></span><b>Ready, set, go!</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a head start. Create lists for both gifts and meals in order begin your shopping early. Doing so will allow you to wrap gifts several weeks beforehand, as well as make some </span><a href="http://www.geniuskitchen.com/ideas/make-ahead-thanksgiving-side-dish-6275"><span style="font-weight: 400;">side dishes to freeze</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, giving you less to do as the holiday draws near. No one wants to be basting a ham with one hand while tying a bow with the other, so start now and give yourself the gift of time to enjoy!</p>
<p></span><b>Deep Clean &amp; De-Clutter, PRONTO. Like now… Go, go, go!</p>
<p></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give your home a deep-clean early in November so that you will only have to maintain it through the holidays. Trust us, the psychotic dance of the crazed cleaner isn’t a Christmas memory you’ll want your kids to have. A deep clean now will make a touch up when company comes over a breeze.</p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to de-clutter, rent a </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local self storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pack away items you are replacing with Christmas decor. With sizes and prices designed to fit every price point, finding one that fits your budget won’t be difficult. Your home will feel less cramped, and when the season is over, you can place your holiday decor there for safekeeping the whole year through.</p>
<p></span><b>Create a “How Can I Help List”</p>
<p></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When company comes over, people are always asking how they can help. Rather than pray to the heavens they simply leave you alone to do it yourself (cue laser-beam, back-off stare), have a list of assignments people can help you with readily available, so they can take tasks that are truly helpful (</span><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Deal-With-Annoying-Relatives"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rather than annoying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). One neat idea is to place all of the assignments on post it notes on the side of the fridge. When someone asks what they can do, point to the papers and let them grab one. Boo-ya. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>&#8220;He who has not Christmas in his heart will never find it under a tree.&#8221;</em><br />
</strong><strong>—Roy L. Smith</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, the season isn’t about the wacky, busy, holiday hustle we get into. It is a time to reflect on family, friendships and faith. And with a little extra planning through easy preparation and <a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storage ideas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this winter will be one you’ll be able to enjoy. </span></p>
<p></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now go make some beautiful memories! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s that time of year again! Crisp weather, roaring fires, and an elegantly set table surrounded by family and friends.</p>
<p>Sing your heart out to Rudolph, you know you want to. Rockin’ around the Christmas tree? You’ll boogie the whole night through.</p>
<p>Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. Oh!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holidays. Pure cheer. Pure joy. Pure laughter&#8230; And pure, undiluted, inundating, overwhelming debt. Funny, Norman Rockwell doesn’t seem to have a painting titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fat Man Did Us In and Now We’re Broke</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</p>
<p>Too bad. Would be a classic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that the holidays only increase your poundage and not your overdraft fees (hey listen, we’re sneaking an extra piece of pie, too!), these simple ideas are ways you can earn a little extra cash this season. Who knows, you may consider keeping these easy side gigs going to help with expenses the whole year through.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><br />
</b><b>Rent with AirBnB</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AirBnB’s have skyrocketed in popularity, offering individuals, couples and families their choice of accommodations in locations across the world. Consider </span><a href="https://learnairbnb.com/airbnb-hosting-beginners-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renting out your home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an AirBnB while you and your family are away this holiday season. Compensation is more than fair, providing you with some extra cha-ching this time of year. Though guests are well vetted and rated before they are able to stay within your home, you can easily store important documents and valuables in a </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local self-storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at minimal cost to you.</p>
<p></span><b>Cash in with Coinstar</p>
<p></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extra change lying around your home? Bring it to your </span><a href="https://www.coinstar.com/findakiosk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local Coinstar machine.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can either get hard cash (with a minimal fee per dollar) or take home a gift card to countless retailers with no fee at all. Talk about an easy way to put some cash aside for holiday shopping.</p>
<p></span><b>Sell on Amazon</p>
<p></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have any used books, DVD’s, CD’s or electronics? Create an </span><a href="https://services.amazon.com/content/sell-on-amazon.htm?ld=SCSOAStriploginnodeeplink"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon sellers account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and sell them to Amazon directly or to other users online. People even create their own businesses the whole year through, sorting through garage sales, bookstores and thrift shops for items of interest they can sell at higher profits, keeping their inventory in a </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self-storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for safe keeping.</p>
<p></span><b>Save on Groceries</p>
<p></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kick up the savings at the Grocery store by downloading an app that will help you find the best deals or obtain rebates/cash back on what you already buy. With so many to choose from, </span><a href="https://www.pennypinchinmom.com/the-best-apps-to-save-money/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">finding one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that fits your shopping habits is a breeze.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your trendy gray and white trim decor could grace the cover of Home &amp; Garden in a flash, while your Hobby Lobby decorations are positioned perfectly to tell your family’s sweet story.</p>
<p></span>Simple beautiful.</p>
<p>The picturesque landscape you have so eloquently created is stunning to say the least, yet a dark secret lurks within your paradise, containing messy piles accumulated to heights unknown.</p>
<p>That’s alright, we know.</p>
<p>That’s why you’re here after all.</p>
<p>Your closets are in need of some TLC.</p>
<p>Don’t fret!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These simple organizing tips and </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storage ideas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will help you maximize your closet-space, leaving your home clutter (and alternate-dirty-dimension) free. </span></p>
<p><b>Stackable Hangers</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider purchasing </span><a href="https://www.containerstore.com/s/closet/hangers/non-slip/joy-mangano-ivory-huggable-hangers/123d?productId=10023851&amp;country=US&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_source=tcscompshop&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=google&amp;cid=cse:PLA&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1IultfeO1wIVg1uGCh1zGQleEAQYAiABEgL3B_D_BwE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hangers that can stack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> along with one another, rather than ones that just rest on their own. You can easily group items of clothing that are similar in style or color together, without taking up as much square footage. Some are even lined with velvet, to help keep your clothes in place. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Ascending Accessories</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of keeping accessories (purses/ties/scarves) on shelves within your closet, place them on </span><a href="https://www.target.com/c/hooks-hookrails-hardware-home-improvement/over-the-door-hook/-/N-5xtt4Z5dc9z"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hooks that line your closet door</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sorting through your accessories will be a breeze, leaving space for larger items inside. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Seasonal Storage</p>
<p></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider placing seasonal clothing into plastic bins and then placing them within a small, local </span><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self-storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As the seasons change you can place items away, leaving more room for things you are presently in need of. You can even use your storage unit to keep seasonal home decor or sporting equipment your family uses.</p>
<p></span><b>Up Top<br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most high shelving areas are rarely utilized to their potential due to their awkward placement. Purchase </span><a href="https://www.walmart.com/c/kp/collapsible-storage-containers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collapsible bins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (that are clearly labeled) to place there, in order to keep items neatly tucked away.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Down Low</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/category/storage-cleaning/closet-storage/shoe-racks-storage/12213/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoe racks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can double up as extra storage for items you may need, lining the bottom of your closet area. You can keep your shoes contained by style or color, rather than having them lay throughout your closet floor, as well as place magazines, wallets or hats.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Peg ‘Em!</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place a </span><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/TheWallPegStore/jewelry-organization-pegboard-ideas/?lp=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">peg board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within your closet to use to hang jewelry. The board can be placed on a share of wall that goes unused. Your jewelry will be easy to sort through and look lovely hanging up. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Be Generous</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, if you haven’t used it, don’t plan on using it, or aren’t even sure what it is (yep, we’ve been there!) either get rid of it or </span><a href="http://www.goodwill.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">give it away</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to someone in need.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the scope of a happy life, a messy desk or an overstuffed coat closet is a trivial thing, yet I find &#8211; and I hear from other people that they agree &#8211; that getting rid of clutter gives a disproportionate boost to happiness.” —Gretchen Rubin</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">By utilizing these simple </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.storageseeker.com">storage ideas</a> and organizing tips</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you will no longer have to panic when your closet door is ajar.</p>
<p>To your newly neat closet space! </span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Even though storage rental rates have gone up typically in Linden, that does not mean all storage facilities there have raised their prices. There was an average price increase of 13.4% over the past week. You can compare prices at many different places using StorageSeeker and perhaps reserve a space at a spot farther from your location can save you some cash. There are different rents charged for different space sizes also, which can possibly lessen some expenses as well. If you are in a position to fit your items right into a more compact space size, that may help reduce a few of the influence of climbing market <a href="http://www.storageseeker.com/search/NJ-Linden">storage prices in Linden</a>. One method to check up on this in the home can be to rope off the measurements of several space dimensions in your car port or living area to check on if the cardboard boxes and various other items you should store will fit in. In the event that you believed you required a 150 square feet unit, perchance you might possibly fit all your stuff right into a 100 square foot unit? You can make an outline of those two unit sizes using tape and observe if you think items will fit. You can also compare all available unit sizes on StorageSeeker and perhaps there is an odd-sized unit that is close to what you need that has not increased as much in price.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>In the past week, self storage costs in Merriam went up by 2.2%. This does not look good for companies or people relocating to Merriam, as their moving costs may have risen just. Since rental rates for mini storage have risen, in case you are <a href="http://www.storageseeker.com/search/KS-Merriam">relocating to Merriam</a>, you might want to promptly rent a self storage unit to store items throughout your move temporarily. This way, if prices continue to go up, you have locked-in a lower price than those future hikes. When moving there are lots and lots of different costs that need to be taken into account, temporary storage being one of them. Organizing and keeping track of all of these costs can be a challenge, especially when you do not yet live where you are moving. <a href="http://www.storageseeker.com">StorageSeeker</a> can at least help you compare and reserve an available storage unit in Merriam to help alleviate one portion of a likely stressful moving experience.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>-3.0% was the decrease in self storage unit prices over the last week in Lakewood. When you see a decrease of -3.0% like there was over the past week, you might want to think about renting a new <a href="http://www.storageseeker.com/search/CO-Lakewood">storage unit in Lakewood</a> to take advantage of these cheap prices. You can view all of the available move-in specials and discounts as well using <a href="http://www.storageseeker.com">StorageSeeker.com</a>. That gives you a double benefit: a reduced market price for self storage space and a potential move-in special as well.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>StorageSeeker has some terrific news! Storage rents in East Greenwich have declined -7.6%! This reduction in rents happened over the past week. If you were looking at leasing a <a href="http://www.storageseeker.com/search/RI-East-Greenwich">self storage space in East Greenwich</a>, do not delay any longer as self storage rents increase as time passes usually. This may only be a short-term market response to either seasonality or a new self storage property being developed - we aren\'t sure. What we can say for certain, nevertheless, is that you could take benefit from this rent reduction and hold a mini storage space in East Greenwich free of charge using <a href="http://www.storageseeker.com">StorageSeeker</a>. That way you can lock-in these reduced rents and stretch your budget.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>As the market rent for storage in Bluffton has gone up, you might still be able to find an attractive price on StorageSeeker. During the past week, the average price for storage units in Bluffton went up by 4.3%. While this may be a dismay to new renters either requiring local storage or <a href="http://www.storageseeker.com/search/SC-Bluffton">moving to Bluffton</a>, those who have already rented a space there may be assured in knowing they may have leased at a lesser rental rate. As the market rent has risen, that is just the average rent disseminated over a wide number of different properties. All prices likely did not go up on all unit sizes in Bluffton. One way to potentially get a reduced price for storage is to look at different unit sizes on a per square foot basis. There might be a slightly bigger or smaller space than the precise size you were looking for, but it could be at a better price on a comparative per square foot basis. Be sure to evaluate all of the available sizes and rents on <a href="http://www.storageseeker.com">StorageSeeker</a> and then reserve the one that you prefer.</p>
